    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>About the pasta alla carbonara there are plenty of myths and believes. Many thinks that the carbonara recipe comes from the carbonaris, which were the old coal sellers, and former creators of the carboneria secret society.<br> the reason for this association would not only be cause by the name of the dish, but also for its pour ingredients. <br> 
    Eggs, cheese, pasta and pepper are the only main ingredients of this delicious dish, and these are indeed products that poor coal sellers of the 1600 would had in their pantry. <br>
    Sadly, this myth don't seem to have solid roots; Carbonara dish was actually invented by an american man in modern times. <br>
    Nontheless, even though its creation myth has been debunked, Carbonara still remains one of the most popular italian dishes in Italy, a dish that it's so popular that it even got it's own memes.<br>
    For instance, for a guy to brag to be able to cook "the best carbonara" is something very lame; it's very clique to like Carbonara and to actually order it at the restaurant, and some people like to separate themselves from the masses saying something like "Amatriciana is nicer than carbonara";<br>
    and of course, the innate urge of every italian to discuss about the endless argument about the ingredients of the carbonara, while some people cannot accept to use another type of meat than guanciale, and cannot even think about using another type of cheese instead of pecorino romano;<br>
    some others do not feel the need of using the real ingredients, and affirmate that the dish is pretty similar, if not equal to the original dish even though it got, for instance, bacon and parmesan. 
    <br>For me, everything is acceptable, guanciale costs more than bacon and sometimes is difficult to find it in common supermarkets, and parmesan cheese is more affordable than pecorino romano, like a lot more.
    <br>But there is something that isn't accettable: <strong>TO PUT CREAM IN THE CARBONARA!</strong>

    <h2>Spaghetti alla Carbonara</h2>    
    
    <h3>Ingredients (for just one person):</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spaghetti</strong> whatever brand, but they must be of medium size, 100 g</li><br>
        <li><strong>Pecorino romano cheese</strong> (or parmesan, whatever), something about 20 g</li><br>
        <li><strong>Guanciale meat</strong> (or bacon, just make sure that it comes with fat) 50 g</li><br>
        <li><strong>Egg yolks</strong> usually 1 and half are enough for one person, also two will be fine</li><br>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong> enough, remember that guanciale is already salty</li><br>
        <li><strong>Black pepper</strong> enough </li><br>
    </ul>  
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    
    <ol>
        <li> Put a water pot to boil, prepare the guanciale cutting it at little squareds or a little stripes (listarelle). Try to take the fatty parts.</li><br>
        <li> Put the cutted meat in a pan and start frying it at vivacios flame. Don't use any oil, we don't need it cause we already have the guanciale meat</li><br>
        <li>In the meanwhile, prepare the egg separating the yolk from the rest of the egg, (you can save the white for other recipes). put the yolk in a cup, and with it put also half of the grated cheese in the cup</li><br>
        <li>Add some salt and some black pepper at the cup, and start vivaciously stiring the mixture with something like a fork</li><br>
        <li>When the meat is more crispy and you see that in the pan there's liquid fat, you can off the flame and separate the pieces of guanciale from the fat. Save the fat, that's important.</li><br>
        <li>Put the pasta in hot water when it's boiling</li><br>
        <li>Let the fat get a little more cold, and then mix a little part of it slowly to the egg cup. You want to be able to control how much fat your getting in, so the composture don't become too liquid, nor it starts cook if the fat is still too much hot. Take not of the fact that the egg will try to become a scrumbled fry egg if you give to it a little too much warm, and we don't want a fried egg, we want a cream basically</li><br>
        <li>When the pasta is ready, save half a cup of that precious water and then take the pastan out. gather the pasta and the egg composture in a cup, or better, in the same pan that fried the guanciale, and start stirring it the whole stuff.</li><br>
        <li> You just put hot pasta with the egg, so it will start again to try to become a fried scumbled egg, you must stir it vivaciouly so it doesn't achieve its goal. Also add the hot water, its amids will make the magic </li><br>
        <li>Add also the fried quanciale and the last part of the cheese. Keep stiring untill the pasta is covered in a nice cream and the colour is a nice yellow. If you're not satisfied with the density, you can adjust warming the pan a little with the flame, but carefull though, cause that thing is going to transform in a fried egg with pasta</li><br>
        <li>If you did well, you will notice it from instict, if you did some mistake, you'll also notice it from instict. Don't be harsh to yourself though, carbonara while it have very few ingredients is pretty hard in execution, and a good carbonara is a perfect one. just keep trying</li>
    </ol>
